```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
<!-- note use of specification for image sort of a la html (along with no quotes, and double backslashes in filepath)-->

Alternately, we'll try using **knitr syntax** along with *include_graphics* to achieve the same but resized (and also centered)... 
<!--below, I use options in knitr syntax to resize image and center it, also, to knit to PDF file path within knitr specification must be "C:/dir/subdir/subsubdir/img.type", while for knitting to HTML the filepath must be specified as "C:\\dir\\subdir\\subsubdir\\img.type" -->
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Ed_R\\Pictures\\peltier.gif")
```
<!-- now we'll try the standard html format for inserting an image from local, or we could also use a URL... ***I've put the image into the same dir used to create this file-->
A different way using 'pure' html tags and local file source...   
<center><img src="peltier.gif" width=400px></center>

## R Markdown 
<!-- use regular html comments, if you wish -->
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
<!--hereI added an option to center the figure, using the knitr syntax-->
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
