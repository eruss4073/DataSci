# DataSci
This is a repo for example analyses and other work related to data science in general. It serves as a portfolio. If you'd like, you may view course certificates I've earned, courses I've audited, notable courses I've taken, and example analyses and data products:

## Analyses & Data Products
[LaTeX using Sweave](https://github.com/eruss4073/DataSci/blob/master/SweaveTest1.pdf) - I also have here a simple example of a LaTeX document I created using R so that figures and R code can be included in the document. It is an example of a type of static report I can generate for distribution or hosting. 

[Final M.L. Project](https://eruss4073.github.io/grandmaster/) - Here is my final course project website for Machine Learning which implements and compares random decision forest, bootstrap aggregated decision tree, gradient boosting machine, and linear discriminant analysis models. The data is from accelerometers attached to subjects' bodies as they perform various movements and was used for classification. It was an interesting supervised learning problem. I used recursive feature elimination, cross validation, and stacking and ensembling steps to test and improve model performance. 

[Data Model Analytics Flux Density Time Series Final Project](/EdR_DMA_SemesterProject2016.pdf) - This is a semester project from a graduate Data Model Analytics course. It focuses on working with time series data and implements harmonic regression using Fourier frequencies to model data in combination with the implementation of autoregressive moving average models for gap filling and forecasting. There is also a custom numerical integration function used to calculate definite integrals. This was a really fun one! *For brevity, the summary does not contain all the source code.*

[3-D numerical advection-diffusion-reaction model](/Ed_Russell_Final_Project_EcosysDynam.pdf) - Here is a presentation for a semester project for a graduate modeling course focused on ecosystem dynamics. I created a 3-D numerical advection-diffusion-reaction model which solves a system of ordinary differential equations to determine the value of the model currency through space and time. It's about phytoplankton, but could really be modified or overhauled for use with other problems where various pools of resources exchange currency via fluxes described by differential equations with time derivatives. *For brevity, the presentation does not contain all the source code.*
